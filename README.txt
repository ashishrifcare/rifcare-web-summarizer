Project: Browser Extension

Description:
This is a lightweight browser extension (Chrome/Chromium-based browsers) that includes a popup UI, content script, background logic, and localization. It provides small utility functionality via popup and interacts with web pages using the content script. The extension is packaged with icons and localized messages for English and Spanish.

Key Benefits:
- Quick access: provides a small popup UI for fast user interactions.
- Page integration: uses content scripts to interact with web pages and manipulate or extract content.
- Background processing: handles persistent tasks and events in the background script.
- Localization: supports multi-language strings via `_locales` (English and Spanish provided).
- Lightweight and easy to modify: the codebase is small and organized for customization.

How to use:
1. Load the extension into Chrome/Chromium-based browsers:
   - Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions
   - Enable "Developer mode" (top-right).
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select the `extension/` folder (the folder containing `manifest.json`).

2. After loading, the extension icon appears in the toolbar. Click the icon to open the popup UI (`popup.html`).

3. The popup UI will call `popup.js` to perform actions (for example, sending messages to `background.js` or `content_script.js`). The content script runs on matching pages as defined in `manifest.json`.

4. To inspect behavior:
   - Right-click the popup and choose "Inspect" to open Developer Tools for popup context.
   - Open chrome://extensions, find the extension and click "background page" (if using Service Worker background, use the "service worker" link) to inspect background logs.
   - On a web page where content scripts run, open DevTools and check the Console to see messages from `content_script.js`.

Files in the project:
- manifest.json: Extension manifest that declares permissions, scripts, and UI.
- background.js: Background script for handling events and long-lived logic.
- content_script.js: Script injected into matched web pages to interact with page content.
- popup.html: HTML for the extension popup UI.
- popup.js: Logic for popup interactions and messaging with background/content scripts.
- README.txt: This file (project documentation).
- _locales/en/messages.json: English localization strings.
- _locales/es/messages.json: Spanish localization strings.
- icons/icon-16.png, icon-48.png, icon-128.png: Extension icons for various UI placements.
- README.md: (If present) may contain project-specific notes or usage.

Technologies used:
- JavaScript (vanilla) for background, content, and popup scripts.
- HTML/CSS for the popup UI.
- Browser Extension API (Chrome extension manifest v2 or v3 depending on `manifest.json`).

APIs and Permissions (likely in `manifest.json`):
- chrome.runtime: messaging between popup, background, and content scripts.
- chrome.tabs: interact with browser tabs (optional, if declared in manifest).
- host permissions: access to matching web pages to inject content scripts (declared as match patterns in manifest).
- storage: to store preferences or data (if used).

Notes and tips for contributors:
- Check `manifest.json` to confirm manifest version (v2 or v3). If migrating to Manifest V3, ensure background script is a service worker and update APIs accordingly.
- Keep localized strings in `_locales/*/messages.json` and reference them from HTML or JS using chrome.i18n.getMessage.
- Use `console.log` statements in popup.js, background.js, and content_script.js while developing. Open the respective DevTools to view logs.
- Respect user privacy: only request the minimal permissions required. Document any data collected and why.

Troubleshooting:
- Extension not loading: ensure `manifest.json` is valid JSON and contains required fields.
- Content script not running: confirm match patterns in `manifest.json` and that the target page URL matches.
- Messaging failures: ensure message listeners are set up and that scripts are loaded.

- Add a LICENSE file if you want to specify project licensing (e.g., MIT).
